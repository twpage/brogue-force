brogue-force
============

Various mods and experiments on brogue, the world's greatest roguelike, created by Brian Walker.
Currently windows-only, contact me if interested in doing a mac or linux port.

Changes from "real" Brogue 1.7.4:
* Archives all games regardless of high score status to BrogueScoresArchive.txt, with the intention of being easy to parse. The file is tab-delimited and the fields are:
** Score (same)
** Time completed (same)
** Death Message (same)
** Level Killed/Finished
** Killed by/Victory
** Had Amulet? (1 for yes, 0 for no)
** Number of Lumenstones
** Was Victory? (1 for yes, 0 for no)
